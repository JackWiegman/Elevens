Activity 6:
1. 5clubs & 6clubs, 5spades & 6clubs
2. Yes, the way the game works, if the deck is empty, then the board has to have matches, if theres 3 cards left, there will be no pairs so it has to be a J Q K
3. Yes, replace pairs that you have replaced more of earlier so there's a bigger chance to get a card that will be a pair with another card.
